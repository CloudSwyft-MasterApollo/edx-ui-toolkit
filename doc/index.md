The edX UI Toolkit is a JavaScript library for building edX web applications. It consists of:

* Backbone views to implement patterns as defined by the [edX Pattern Library](http://ux.edx.org).
* Utility methods to simplify the creation and testing of user interfaces.

The toolkit is an open source library that is hosted on [GitHub]({{ site.data.edx-ui-toolkit.url_github }}),
and that can be installed as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/edx-ui-toolkit).

You can read more on the [edX Front End Development wiki](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/display/FEDX/).
